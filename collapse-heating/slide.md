<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0">After recombination, the universe was in a nearly-but-not-totally homogeneous state, seeded with instabilities and with a few residual electrons.</p>
<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
<p>Early-on, dark matter clumps collected and formed "halos," drawing in baryonic material.</p>
<p>This process converted potential energy into thermal energy, heating the baryonic matter, which shed the thermal energy through radiative processes.</p>

<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Eventually, this cloud becomes fully-molecular through the three-body interaction and forms an accretion disk.</p>
